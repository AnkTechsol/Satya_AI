### Added
- **Enterprise ROI Dashboard**: A new page in the UI that estimates manual labor costs ($50/hr), calculates agent token cost ($0.50/task), and computes the total cost savings and hours saved by the AI agents.
- Implemented **Agent Self-Test Harness + CI Analytics Job** to continuously test agent workflows, mock the simulation environment for CI, and auto-update performance traces into `repo_analytics.json` and `REPO_ANALYTICS.md` automatically on push.
- Created `repo_analytics.json` and updated `REPO_ANALYTICS.md` with recent execution telemetry via the snapshot branch.
- Initial **Repo Analytics** script (`repo_analytics.json`, `REPO_ANALYTICS.md`) to measure repo health.
- Added **Competitor Matrix** (`COMPETITOR_MATRIX.md`) to guide strategic roadmap.
- Implemented **Export Adapter Framework** (OTLP/Log export interface) to support enterprise integrations.
